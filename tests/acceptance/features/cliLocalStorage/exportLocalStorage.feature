Feature: export created mounts from the command line
  As an admin
  I want to export all created mounts from the command line
  So that I can view available mounts

  Scenario: export the created mounts
    Given the administrator has created the local storage mount "local_storage2"
    And the administrator has created the local storage mount "new_local_storage"
    And the administrator has uploaded file with content "this is a file in local storage" to "/local_storage2/file-in-local-storage.txt"
    And the administrator has uploaded file with content "new file" to "/new_local_storage/new-file"
    When the administrator exports the mounts using the occ command
    Then the following local storage should be listed:
      | MountPoint         | Storage | AuthenticationType | Configuration | Options | ApplicableUsers | ApplicableGroups |
      | /local_storage2    | Local   | None               | datadir:      |         | All             |                  |
      | /new_local_storage | Local   | None               | datadir:      |         | All             |                  |
      | /local_storage     | Local   | None               | datadir:      |         | All             |                  |
