  As a user
  I want to be able to download files
  So that I can work wih local copies of files on my client system

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And user "user0" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "ownCloud test text file 0" to "/textfile0.txt"
    And user "user0" has uploaded file "filesForUpload/lorem.txt" to "/welcome.txt"

  Scenario Outline: download a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "user0" downloads file "/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the downloaded content should be "ownCloud test text file 0"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

  Scenario Outline: download a file with range
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "user0" downloads file "/welcome.txt" with range "bytes=51-77" using the WebDAV API
    Then the downloaded content should be "example file for developers"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |

  Scenario Outline: download a file larger than 4MB (ref: https://github.com/sabre-io/http/pull/119 )
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "user0" has uploaded file "/file9000000.txt" ending with "text at end of file" of size 9000000 bytes
    When user "user0" downloads file "/file9000000.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the size of the downloaded file should be 9000000 bytes
    And the downloaded content should end with "text at end of file"

      | dav_version |
      | old         |

  Scenario Outline: Downloading a file should serve security headers
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    When user "user0" downloads file "/welcome.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the following headers should be set
      | header                            | value                                                            |

      | Content-Security-Policy           | default-src 'none';                                              |
      | X-Content-Type-Options            | nosniff                                                          |
      | X-Download-Options                | noopen                                                           |
      | X-Frame-Options                   | SAMEORIGIN                                                       |
      | X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies | none                                                             |

      | old         |
      | new         |

  Scenario Outline: Doing a GET with a web login should work without CSRF token on the new backend
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "user0" has logged in to a web-style session
    When the client sends a "GET" to "/remote.php/dav/files/user0/welcome.txt" without requesttoken
    Then the downloaded content should start with "Welcome to your ownCloud account!"
    And the HTTP status code should be "200"
    Examples:
      | dav_version |
      | old         |
      | new         |
