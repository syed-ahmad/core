  Scenario Outline: delete a file
    Given using <dav_version> DAV path
    And user "user0" has uploaded file with content "to delete" to "/textfile0.txt"
    When user "user0" deletes file "/textfile0.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "204"
    And as "user0" file "/textfile0.txt" should not exist
